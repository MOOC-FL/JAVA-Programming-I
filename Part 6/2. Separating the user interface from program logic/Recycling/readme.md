> Recycling

> When concepts have been separated into different classes in the code,
recycling them and reusing them in other projects becomes easy. 
For example, the class 'WordSet' could be used in a graphical user
interface, and it could also be part of a mobile phone application. In addition, testing the program is much easier when it has been divided into several concepts, 
each of which has its own separate logic and can function alone as a unit.

- Let's examine the process of implementing a program and separating different areas of responsibility from each other. The program asks the user to write words until they write the same word twice.
- Let's build this program piece by piece. One of the challenges is that it is difficult to decide how to approach the problem, or how to split the problem into smaller subproblems, and from which subproblem to start. There is no one clear answer
- sometimes it is good to start from the problem domain and its concepts and their connections, sometimes it is better to start from the user interface.
- We could start implementing the user interface by creating a class UserInterface. The user interface uses a Scanner object for reading user input. This object is given to the user interface.

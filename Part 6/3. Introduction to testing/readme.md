### Error Situations and Step-By-Step Problem Resolving
- Errors end up in the programs that we write. Sometimes the errors are not serious and cause headache mostly to users of the program. Occasionally, however, mistakes can lead to very serious consequences. In any case, it's certain that a person learning to program makes many mistakes.

- You should never be afraid of or avoid making mistakes since that is the best way to learn. For this reason, try to break the program that you're working on from time to time to investigate error messages, and to see if those messages tell you something about the error(s) you've made.

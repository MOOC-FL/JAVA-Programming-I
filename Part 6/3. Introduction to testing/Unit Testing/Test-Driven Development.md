### Test-Driven Development
> Test-driven development is a software development process that's based on constructing a piece of software in small iterations. In test-driven software development, the first thing a programmer always does is write an automatically-executable test, which tests a single piece of the computer program.

* [ ] The test will not pass because the functionality that satisfies the test,
* [ ]  i.e., the part of the computer program to be examined, is missing.
* [ ]   Once the test has been written, functionality that meets the test requirements is added to the program.
* [ ]    The tests are then run again.
* [ ]    If all tests pass, a new test is added, or alternatively,
* [ ]    if the tests fail, the already-written program is corrected.
* [ ]    If necessary, the internal structure of the program will be corrected or refactored,
* [ ]     so that the functionality of the program remains the same, but the structure becomes clearer.
> Test-driven software development consists of five steps that are repeated until the functionality of the program is complete.

- The report in the address MCO_report.pdf describes an incident resulting from a more serious software error and also the error itself.

- The bug in the software was caused by the fact that the program in question expected the programmer to use the International System of Units (meters, kilograms, ...) in the calculations. However, the programmer had used the American Measurement System for some of the system's calculations, which prevented the satellite navigation auto-correction system from working as inteded.

### The satellite was destroyed.

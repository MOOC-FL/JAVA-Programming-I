#### Part 7

- In the seventh part of the course we'll focus on general programming paradigms and algorithms. The course Introduction to programming (TKT-10002) ends 
after the seventh week, and the Advanced course in programming (TKT-10003) begins with the eight part.

#### In this part:
1. Programming paradigms
2. Algorithms
3. Larger programming exercises
4. Conclusion

- The table of contents above lists the topics of the seventh part of the course. 
The seventh part has been designed to cover the seventh week of the course. 
You should reserve well above 10 hours for each part of the course, depending on previous experience with computers. If you've tried programming before, you might advance faster in the beginning.

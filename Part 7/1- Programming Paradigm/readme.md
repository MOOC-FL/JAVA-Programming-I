#### Programming paradigms
- A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring a program's functionality. Programming paradigms differ from one another, for example in how the program's execution and control are defined and what components the programs consist of.

- Most programming languages ​​that are currently in use support multiple programming paradigms. Part of a programmer's growth involves the ability, through experience, to choose the appropriate programming language and paradigm; there currently is no single ubiquitous programming language and programming paradigm.

- The most common programming paradigms today are object-oriented programming, procedural programming, and functional programming. The first two of these are briefly discussed in what follows.

#### Object-Oriented Programming
- In object-oriented programming, information is represented as classes that describe the concepts of the problem domain and the logic of the application. Classes define the methods that determine how information is handled. During program execution, objects are instantiated from classes that contain runtime information and that also have an effect on program execution: program execution typically proceeds through a series of method calls related to the objects. As mentioned a few weeks ago, "the program is built from small, clear, and cooperative entities."
- The basic ideas of **object-oriented programming**, ie, **the representation of information and its processing methods** with the help of classes and objects, first appeared in Simula 67 , which was designed for developing simulations and the Smalltalk programming language. Its breakthrough came in the 1980s through the C++ programming language and Java has made it one of the most widely used programming paradigms in the world.
- One of the major benefits of object-oriented programming is how problem-domain concepts are modeled through classes and objects, which makes programs easier to understand. In addition, structuring the problem domain into classes facilitates the construction and maintenance of programs. However, object-oriented programming is not inherently suited to all problems: for example, scientific computing and statistics applications typically make use of languages, such as R and Python .

- In the case of multiple conditionals, we use the `else if-command`. The command `else if` is like else, but with an additional condition. `else if` follows the if-condition, and they may be multiple.
```java
int number = 3;

if (number == 1) {
    System.out.println("The number is one");
} else if (number == 2) {
    System.out.println("The given number is two");
} else if (number == 3) {
    System.out.println("The number must be three!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Something else!");
}
```

#### Order of Execution for Comparisons
- The comparisons are executed top down. When execution reaches a conditional statement whose condition is true, its block is executed and the comparison stops.
```java
int number = 5;

if (number == 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
} else if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is greater than zero.");
} else if (number > 2) {
    System.out.println("The number is greater than two.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is less than zero.");
}
```
> The example above prints the string "The number is greater than zero." even if the condition `number > 2` is true. The comparison stops at the first condition that evaluates to true.

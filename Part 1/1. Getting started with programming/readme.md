- Modern programming is practically always done in an IDE (integrated development environment). An IDE contains a set of useful tools for the programmer. It does not create the program by itself, but it can give hints about common mistakes in the code, and help the programmer understand the structure of the program.
- This is the first programming exercise of this course. In this exercise, you'll familiarize yourself with the development environment.
```java
public class Sandbox {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your program here

    }
}
```
#### Programmers Write Source Code
- Programming is designing and implementing software. The functionality is implemented based on the wishes and requirements of the users and the customers. Programs are typically implemented (i.e., written or "coded") in a programming language meant to be written and read by humans.
- Programming languages, such as Java, have many commands built-in that a programmer uses when developing software. This makes programming easier as you don't need to implement everything from scratch. For example, programming languages typically have built-in options available for different `menus` and `views` used for making `graphical user interfaces.` Indeed, a large part of programming is making use of available functions and tools in solving problems — this, however, requires programming experience, which you only gain by programming.
- The "code" you write is called source code. Source code consists of statements and expressions, which are read line by line from top to bottom, and from left to right. For example, to print "Hello world", you can use the pre-defined Java command System.out.println(), to which you need to provide the text inside the parentheses that you'd like to be printed:
```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
> The above statement is pre-built into Java, and it's used for printing a string. The statement tells the computer to output the string that's been provided to it, placed between the quotation marks. The statement ends with a semicolon ;.


> Java programs require a certain frame around the code to work. Don't worry if it appears intimidating, it'll become very familiar over this course. Although you might not be able to make sense of the surrounding frame of code, you could probably guess what this following program does based on the print statement described above.

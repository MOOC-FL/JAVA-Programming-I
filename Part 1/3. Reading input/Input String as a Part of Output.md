#### Input String as a Part of Output
- We noticed in the "Hi Ada Lovelace!" exercise that string literals and string variables can be joined using the + operator. The example below demonstrates a program that takes user input and prints it concatenated with a string literal.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Write something: ");

        String message = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("You wrote " + message);
    }
}

```

#### Printing
##### Learning Objectives
1. Learn to write a program that prints text.
2. Become familiar with executing programs.
3. Know what the term "parameter" means.
> The print command `System.out.println("Hello world");` prints the text `"Hello world"`.
- In this material, text boxes like the one above demonstrate an output produced by the example code. Accordingly, the above program would produce the print output "Hello World!". You can try any of these examples in the exercise template named "Sandbox", which you will find in the programming environment.
- You can print any text you want with the command, as long as the command `System.out.println("arbitrary text");` — i.e., `System` dot `out` dot `println` open parenthesis `(` "the text" close parenthesis `)` and semicolon `;` remains unchanged. The command below will print the text "Hello there!".
```java
System.out.println("Hello there!");
```

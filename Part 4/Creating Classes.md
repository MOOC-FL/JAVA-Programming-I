#### Creating Classes
- A class specifies what the objects instantiated from it are like.
  - The **object's variables (instance variables)** specify the internal state of the object
  - The **object's methods** specify what the object does
- We'll now familiarize ourselves with creating our own classes and defining the variable that belong to them.
- A class is defined to represent some meaningful entity, where a "meaningful entity" often refers to a real-world object or concept. If a computer program had to process personal information, it would perhaps be meaningful to define a seperate class Person consisting of methods and attributes related to an individual.
> Let's begin. We'll assume that we have a project template that has an empty main program:
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```
- Let's create a class named`Person`. For this class, we create a separate file named `Person.java`. Our program now consists of two separate files since the main program is also in its own file. `The Person.java` file initially contains the class definition public class Person and the curly brackets that confine the contents of the class.
```java
public class Person {

}
```
- You can also draw a class diagram to depict a class. We'll become familiar with its notations as we go along. An empty person-named class looks like this:
- A class defines the attributes and behaviors of objects that are created from it. Let's decide that each person object has a name and an age. It's natural to represent the name as a string, and the age as an integer. We'll go ahead and add these to our blueprint:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```
- We specify above that each object created from the`Person` class has a name and an age. Variables defined inside a class are called `instance variables`, or `object field`s or `object attributes`. Other names also seem to exist.
- Instance variables are written on the lines following the class definition `public class Person` {. Each variable is preceded by the keyword `private`. The keyword `private` means that the variables are **"hidden"** inside the object. This is known as **encapsulation**.
- In the class diagram, the variables associated with the class are defined as `"variableName: variableType"`.
- **The minus sign before the variable name indicates that the variable is encapsulated (it has the keyword private).**
- We have now defined a `blueprint — a class —` for the `person` object. Each new person object has the variables name and age, which are able to hold `object-specific values`. The "state" of a person consists of the values assigned to their name and age.

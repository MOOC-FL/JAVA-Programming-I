#### Creating Classes
- A class specifies what the objects instantiated from it are like.
  - The **object's variables (instance variables)** specify the internal state of the object
  - The **object's methods** specify what the object does
- We'll now familiarize ourselves with creating our own classes and defining the variable that belong to them.
- A class is defined to represent some meaningful entity, where a "meaningful entity" often refers to a real-world object or concept. If a computer program had to process personal information, it would perhaps be meaningful to define a seperate class Person consisting of methods and attributes related to an individual.
> Let's begin. We'll assume that we have a project template that has an empty main program:
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```
- Let's create a class named` Person`. For this class, we create a separate file named `Person.java`. Our program now consists of two separate files since the main program is also in its own file. `The Person.java` file initially contains the class definition public class Person and the curly brackets that confine the contents of the class.

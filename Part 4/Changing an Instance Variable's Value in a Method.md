#### Changing an Instance Variable's Value in a Method
- Let's add a method to the previously created person class that increments the age of the person by a year.
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
    }

    // growOlder() method has been added
    public void growOlder() {
        this.age = this.age + 1;
    }
}
```
- The method is written inside the `Person` class just as the `printPerson` method was. The method increments the value of the instance variable `age` by one.
- Let's call the method and see what happens:
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person ada = new Person("Ada");
        Person antti = new Person("Antti");

        ada.printPerson();
        antti.printPerson();
        System.out.println("");

        ada.growOlder();
        ada.growOlder();

        ada.printPerson();
        antti.printPerson();
    }
}
```
The program's print output is as follows:
```text
Ada, age 0 years
Antti, age 0 years

Ada, age 2 years
Antti, age 0 years
```
- That is to say that when the two objects are "born" they're both zero-years old (`this.age = 0;` is executed in the constructor). The `ada` object's `growOlder` method is called twice. As the print output demonstrates, the age of Ada is 2 years after growing older. Calling the method on an object corresponding to Ada has no impact on the age of the other person object since each object instantiated from a class has its own instance variables.
- The method can also contain conditional statements and loops. The growOlder method below limits aging to 30 years.
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
    }

    // no one exceeds the age of 30
    public void growOlder() {
        if (this.age < 30) {
            this.age = this.age + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

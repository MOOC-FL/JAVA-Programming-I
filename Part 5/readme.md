# Part 5

The fifth part of the course material continues with object-oriented programming, which was introduced in the fourth part.

## In this part:

1. Learning object-oriented programming
2. Removing repetitive code (overloading methods and constructors)
3. Primitive and reference variables
4. Objects and references
5. Conclusion

The table of contents above lists the topics of the fifth part of the course. The fifth part has been designed to cover the fifth week of the course. You should reserve well above 10 hours for each part of the course, depending on previous experience with computers. If you've tried programming before, you might advance faster in the beginning.

3. To realize that the use of objects can make a program more understandable.
>As we can see by reading the example above, how a clock consisting of three int variables works is not clear to someone reading the code. By looking at the code, it's difficult to "see" what's going on. A famous programmer once remarked "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand .Good Programmers write code that humans can understand".

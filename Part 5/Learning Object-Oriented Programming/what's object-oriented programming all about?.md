#### So, what's object-oriented programming all about?
Let's step back for a moment and inspect how a clock works. 
The clock has three hands: hours, minutes and seconds. 
1. The second-hand grows once every second
2. the minute hand every sixty seconds
3.  and the hour hand every sixty minutes

- When the value of the second hand is 60, its value is set to zero, and the value of the minute hand grows by one.
- When the minute hand's value is 60, its value is set to zero, and the hour hand's value grows by one.
- When the hour hand's value is 24, it's set to zero.

* [ ]  The time is always printed in the form hours: minutes: seconds, where two digits are used to represent the hour (e.g., 01 or 12) as well as the minutes and seconds.

* [ ]  The clock has been implemented below using integer variables (the printing could be in a separate method, but that has not been done here).

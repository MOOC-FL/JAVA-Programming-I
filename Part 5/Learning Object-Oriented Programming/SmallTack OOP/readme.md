# Smalltalk

Smalltalk is a purely object-oriented programming language (OOP) that was originally created in the 1970s for educational use, specifically for constructionist learning, but later found use in business. It was created at Xerox PARC by Learning Research Group (LRG) scientists, including Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Diana Merry, and Scott Wallace.

## Key Concepts

In Smalltalk, executing programs are built of opaque, atomic objects, which are instances of template code stored in classes. These objects intercommunicate by passing messages via an intermediary virtual machine environment (VM). A relatively small number of objects, called primitives, are not amenable to live redefinition, sometimes being defined independently of the Smalltalk programming environment.

## History and Impact

Having undergone significant industry development toward other uses, including business and database functions, Smalltalk is still in use today. When first publicly released, Smalltalk-80 presented numerous foundational ideas for the nascent field of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Since inception, the language provided interactive programming via an integrated development environment. This requires reflection and late binding in the language execution of code. Later development has led to at least one instance of a Smalltalk execution environment that lacks such an integrated graphical user interface or front-end.

Smalltalk-like languages are in active development and have gathered communities of users around them. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Smalltalk was ratified in 1998 and represents the standard version of Smalltalk.

## Modern Context

Smalltalk took second place for "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017, but it was not among the 26 most loved programming languages of the 2018 survey.
# Influences

Smalltalk was one of many object-oriented programming languages based on Simula. It is also one of the most influential programming languages. Virtually all of the object-oriented languages that came after—Flavors, CLOS, Objective-C, Java, Python, Ruby, and many others—were influenced by Smalltalk. Smalltalk was also one of the most popular languages for agile software development methods, rapid application development (RAD) or prototyping, and software design patterns. The highly productive environment provided by Smalltalk platforms made them ideal for rapid, iterative development.

## Broader Research Impact

Smalltalk emerged from a larger program of Advanced Research Projects Agency-funded research that in many ways defined the modern world of computing. In addition to Smalltalk, working prototypes of things such as hypertext, GUIs, multimedia, the mouse, telepresence, and the Internet were developed by ARPA researchers in the 1960s. Alan Kay (one of the inventors of Smalltalk) also described a tablet computer he named the Dynabook, which resembles modern tablet computers.

## Software Design Patterns

Smalltalk environments were often the first to develop what are now common object-oriented software design patterns. One of the most popular is the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern for user interface design. The MVC pattern enables developers to have multiple consistent views of the same underlying data. It's ideal for:
*   Software development environments, where there are various views (e.g., entity-relation, dataflow, object model, etc.) of the same underlying specification.
*   Simulations or games where the underlying model may be viewed from various angles and levels of abstraction.

## GUI and Development Environment Innovations

In addition to the MVC pattern, the Smalltalk language and environment were influential in the history of:
*   The graphical user interface (GUI)
*   The "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) user interface
*   Font editors
*   Desktop metaphors for UI design

The powerful built-in debugging and object inspection tools that came with Smalltalk environments set the standard for all the integrated development environments that came after, starting with Lisp Machine environments.

## A Cultural Footnote

Smalltalk uses several collection filter operators that rhyme with the "-ect" suffix, such as `collect:`, `select:`, and `inject:into:`. This naming convention was inspired by a line from the 1967 Arlo Guthrie monologue "Alice's Restaurant Massacree," in which Guthrie underwent a battery of being "injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected."

# Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

## Core Practices

Other elements of extreme programming include:
- Programming in pairs or doing extensive code review
- Unit testing of all code
- Not programming features until they are actually needed
- A flat management structure
- Code simplicity and clarity
- Expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood
- Frequent communication with the customer and among programmers

## Methodology Concept

The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously (i.e., the practice of pair programming).

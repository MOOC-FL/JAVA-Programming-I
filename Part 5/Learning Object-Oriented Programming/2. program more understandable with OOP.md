### Our aim is to make the program more understandable.


- Since a clock hand is a clear concept in its own right, a good way to improve the program's clarity would be to turn it into a class.
- Let's create a ClockHand class that describes a clock hand, which contains
* [ ]  information about its value, upper limit (i.e., the point at which the value of the hand returns to zero),
* [ ]   and provides methods for advancing the hand,
* [ ]    viewing its value,
* [ ]    and also printing the value in string form.
